/**
 * LATERAL JOIN allows us to reference the columns from the previous table in a join,
 * and use them as input for the subsequent tables.
 * 
 * LATERAL joins are especially useful to correlate data between tables where the result
 * of one table can influence the join condition or columns of another table.
