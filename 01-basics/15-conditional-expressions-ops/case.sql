/*
 * Since CASE is an expression, you can use it in any places where an expression can be used,
 * e.g., SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING.
 * 
 * If all conditions are false, the CASE expression returns the result that follows the ELSE
 * keyword. If you omit the ELSE clause, the CASE expression returns NULL
